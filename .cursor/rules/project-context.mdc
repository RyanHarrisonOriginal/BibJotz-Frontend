# Project context

- **Production app**: This workspace (`frontend`) is the production app that ships.
- **POC**: The separate project **bibjotz-moc-up-main** is the vibe-coded POC/mock-up used for experimentation.
- **Workflow**: New content and ideas are built in the POC, then **ported into this production app** following the standards and patterns in place here (and any new standards added to the production codebase).
